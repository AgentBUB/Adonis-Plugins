# Adonis-Plugins
A repository of Adonis plugins made by me or community members. 

free to submit your own, just be sure to include information about the plugin in a comment at the top of it, such as author and description.

When someone asks me to make a plugin for some niche use case that doesn't fit in the main script, I'll probably put it here as a plugin.
