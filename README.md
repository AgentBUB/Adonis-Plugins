# Adonis-Plugins
A repository of Adonis plugins made by me or community members. 

Feel free to submit your own, just be sure to include information about the plugin in a comment at the top of it, such as author and description.

When someone asks me to make a plugin for some niche use case that doesn't fit in the main script, I'll probably put it here as a plugin.

If you have an issue with a plugin, or need help setting it up, make sure you contact the AUTHOR. If I (Sceleratis/Davey_Bones) did not make it, do not ask me about it because I probably can't help you.
