Server Plugins must be a ModuleScript with a name starting with Server: followed by a space and then the name of the plugin.

Example:
"Server: UIChanger"


Note: For loaders inserted after June 5th, names such as Server-Whatever, server-WhaTever, server:What Ever are all acceptable. This applies to both client and server plugins and was done to allow for easier file saving and git repo management on a Windows PC.
